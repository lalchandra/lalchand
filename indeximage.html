        <p>[1]I choose friends carefully. I have few friends whom I trust. I don’t regret it. Less people I sit with, less bullshit I would have
           to deal with. And this gives room to pursue my hobbies and expand my horizon in personal development.

          <p>[2]I give time to people who are worth my time and energy. Selfish, self absorbed,
             judgemental and negative people turn me off. I prefer to spend time on my hobbies instead.

            <p>[5]People talk / criticize you — Be it good or bad. They criticize everything.

              not accept your mistake, you will never ever succeed after your failure.[Date:06/03/2019]

            <p>[7]Failure teach you those lessons which even success can’t.

You have to learn all these things when you are facing failure constantly to keep going. There is no other way. :) Trust me pessimism, hopelessness, demotivation, sorrow. They are those heavy burden which you can't
              bear with failure. To move on, to get your life straight, to find your success you need the above things. :)[Date:06/03/2019]
